## Abstract

Introduce the historical development of SSL and TLS and their significance in network security.

## Basic Concept

### Introduction

+ SSL(Secure Sockets Layer): An early encryption protocol developed by Netscape, which has now been replaced by TLS.
+ TLS (Transport Layer Security): The successor to SSL, providing a more secure encryption protocol.

### Key Function

+ Encryption: Ensures that data is not intercepted or altered during transmission.
+ Authentication: Ensures the trustworthiness of the communicating parties.
+ Data Integrity: Ensures that data is not modified during transmission.

## Encryption Method

### Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption

+ Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., DES \ AES).
    ![symmetricEncryption](static/img/symmetricEncyrption.avif)
+ Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption (e.g., RSA).
    ![asymmetricEncryption](static/img/asymmetricEncryption.avif)
